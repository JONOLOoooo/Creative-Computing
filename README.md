# **Creative Computing: Community**

## *Learning*

### Design for Community

- Too much work has been done for individuals. People loes attention on design for society.

- Data tend to describe a lot of people, not a single person.

  > Designing for society means designing for the broader context of systems that we impact and shape. We can redefine our social contract with each other, and with the world that we steward. To do this, we must be intentional about *citizen empowerment*, *civic commons*, *public health*, *equity*, and the *planet*.

- To make the design less hierarchical and exclusionary, enpower the society with more rights and capabilities.

### Creative Computing

- Creative computing can be physical, electronic, experience and in a variety of medias.
- Physical creative computing is one to interact with real life objects.

#### Arduino

- The Arduino Uno is a microsoftcontroller board and with sets of pins which allow you to connect and inferace with other boards and circuits. I have learnt how to connect a circuit and light a LED with the starter kit.

#### GitHub

- An open-source version control/revision control/source control software. a version control system(VAS) can be seen as a database. A centralised version control system(CVCS) allow people in a collaboraation to work on together, while a distributed version control system does not rely on the CVCS and can process different operations when off line.

#### README

- A README File is a document which explains a project in detail and makes the users understand how the project works. It also helps the creator to update and catch up in the future.
- It is an essential file that can be written in md format, which is ***markdown language***.

>The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email.

- It is too difficult for me to manage all the things I learn, so I just put them in these bullet points.

- The concept of creative computing is not so different from what I have imagined, since it was originally a complete new world to me; I know that technology is crucial to lead the design industry towards future needs of people.
- It seems like our course is more about communication, so design for the society will be a big issue to us. Also, I feel like it is not just about solving problems that already exists, it is sometimes a more critical thinking process and building connections between people.
-  Design for society is often related to moral issue and empathy.
- Markdown has brought me to a new way of making notes, I can see its significance to a project and both the uploaders and the users, but writing with Typora seems like taking notes and it is very convenient.

## *Suggestion and Idea Generation*

1. To find a community, it can be a community that has not been defined yet.  
2. The privacy issue. How can the right of an individual remains while building a community?
3. An open source for artists, like a free website generator or an online gallery generator.
4. ...
